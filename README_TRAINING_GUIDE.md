## 🔑 KEY CONCEPTS QUICK REFERENCE

### 1. ID System (Critical!)
```
MASTERID
  • Assigned at creation
  • Never changes
  • Use for: Record identification in Tally
  • Update: Keep for reference

ALTERID
  • Global modification counter
  • Increments on ANY change in Tally
  • Use for: Incremental sync (WHERE ALTERID > lastSync)
  • Critical for: Change detection

GUID
  • Globally unique identifier
  • Unique per record
  • Use for: Deduplication, sync mapping
  • Benefit: Works across systems

Example Usage:
  Fetch changes since last sync:
    SELECT * FROM TALLY WHERE ALTERID > 5000
  
  Identify exact record:
    WHERE GUID = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
  
  Update existing voucher:
    MODIFY VOUCHER WHERE MASTERID = 102
```

### 2. Request/Response Cycle
```
1. Build XML Request
   └─ Define TALLYREQUEST type (Browse, Fetch, VMPost, etc.)
   └─ Add STATICVARIABLES (filters, dates, limits)
   └─ Add BODY data (for create/modify)

2. Send HTTP POST
   └─ URL: http://tally_host:9000/
   └─ Headers: Content-Type: application/xml
   └─ Body: XML request

3. Process Response
   └─ Check STATUS for success/error
   └─ Parse BODY for returned data
   └─ Extract MASTERID, GUID, ALTERID

4. Store Locally
   └─ Save to database
   └─ Track sync state
   └─ Update UI
```

### 3. Sync Strategy
```
Incremental Sync (Most Efficient):
  1. Get last synced ALTERID from database
  2. Query: WHERE ALTERID > lastAlterID
  3. Process returned records
  4. Update local lastAlterID
  5. Repeat on schedule (e.g., every 5 seconds)

Full Historical Sync (Initial Setup):
  1. Start with ALTERID = 0
  2. Fetch in chunks (LIMIT 1000)
  3. Track progress
  4. Store all records
  5. Resume capability if interrupted

Conflict Resolution:
  • Tally is source of truth
  • Always prefer newer ALTERID
  • Match by GUID if same ALTERID
  • Mark deleted records locally
```

### 4. TDL Structure
```
[Report: ReportName]
  └─ [Form: FormName]
     └─ [Part: PartName]
        └─ [Line: LineName]
           └─ [Field: FieldName]
           └─ [Field: OtherField]
     └─ [Part: AnotherPart]

[Table: TableName]
  └─ [Field: FieldName1]
  └─ [Field: FieldName2]

[Field: CustomField]
  ├─ Type: Amount/Number/String/Date
  ├─ Formula: (calculation)
  ├─ Show: Yes/No
  └─ Print: Yes/No

[UDF: CustomUDF]
  ├─ ObjectType: Voucher/Master/etc
  ├─ FieldType: String/Amount/Date
  └─ IsRequired: Yes/No
```

### 5. Database Schema (SQLite)
```
Core Tables:
  • bills (tally_guid, tally_master_id, alter_id, amount, ...)
  • stock_items (name, alter_id, balance, rate, ...)
  • parties (name, alter_id, type, contact, ...)
  • sync_state (last_sync_time, last_sync_alterid, ...)

Tracking Tables:
  • voucher_history (guid, master_id, alter_id, snapshot)
  • voucher_change_log (master_id, old_alter_id, new_alter_id)
  • master_sync_state (entity_type, last_sync_alterid)

Operational Tables:
  • pending_invoices (for offline mode)
  • daily_invoice_counter (auto-increment)
  • receipts (payment records)
```

### 6. GST Essentials
```
Setup:
  • Create tax ledgers (Input/Output SGST, CGST, IGST)
  • Configure rates (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%)
  • Assign HSN codes to items
  • Set GSTIN for company & parties

Calculation:
  Amount = 1000
  SGST (5%) = 50
  CGST (5%) = 50
  Total = 1100

Filing:
  • GSTR-1: Monthly (outward supplies)
  • GSTR-2: Monthly (inward supplies)
  • GSTR-3B: Monthly (tax liability)
  • GSTR-9: Yearly (annual return)

E-Invoicing:
  • Automatic for >₹50,000
  • Generates IRN (64-char code)
  • QR code for print
  • Portal: https://einvoice1.gst.gov.in
```
