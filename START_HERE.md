## 💡 REMEMBER THESE 5 CRITICAL CONCEPTS

### **1. ALTERID is Your Sync Key** 🔑
```
WHERE ALTERID > lastSyncedAlterID
↓
This finds ALL changes since last sync
↓
Most efficient way to keep systems in sync
```

### **2. XML is Universal** 📨
```
All Tally communication happens via XML
└─ HTTP POST requests
└─ Structured request/response format
└─ UTF-8 encoding
```

### **3. Local Database Matters** 💾
```
Always maintain:
└─ Sync state (last ALTERID)
└─ Record history (versioning)
└─ Pending operations (offline mode)
└─ Audit trail (compliance)
```

### **4. Validate Everything** 🛡️
```
Before sending to Tally:
└─ Check required fields
└─ Validate data types
└─ Verify references exist
└─ Ensure business rules
```

### **5. GST is Non-Negotiable** 📊
```
All sales must:
└─ Calculate correct tax
└─ File GSTR returns
└─ Generate e-invoices (>₹50,000)
└─ Maintain audit trail
```
