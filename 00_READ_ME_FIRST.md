## 💡 KEY CONCEPTS AT A GLANCE

### **ALTERID = Your Sync Key 🔑**
```
Use: WHERE ALTERID > lastSync
Result: All changes since last sync
Benefit: Most efficient sync method
```

### **MASTERID = Record Identity 📍**
```
Use: WHERE MASTERID = 102
Result: Single record in Tally
Benefit: Never changes, permanent ID
```

### **GUID = Global Uniqueness 🌐**
```
Use: Deduplication across systems
Result: Unique identifier everywhere
Benefit: Works across all instances
```

### **Incremental Sync = Efficiency 🚀**
```
Use: Poll ALTERID regularly
Result: Only new changes fetched
Benefit: Fast, efficient, reliable
```

### **Local Database = State Tracking 💾**
```
Use: Store sync state, history, pending
Result: Offline-capable system
Benefit: Resilient, audit trail, rollback
```
